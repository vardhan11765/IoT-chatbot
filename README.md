# IoT-chatbot
Developed a IOT chatbot using ppython where i used telegram, adafruit libraries. Used telegram to generate a bot and given commands to control fan and light. I used adafruit for indicators of fan and light. When the user gives command through chatbot, then it will be reacted in adafruit indicator.
